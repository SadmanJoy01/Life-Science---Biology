# Overall Biology 

Biology is the science of living systems — how organisms are built (structure), how they work (function), how they pass traits (genetics), how populations change (evolution), and how organisms interact with each other and the environment (ecology). In healthcare we mainly care about cells, organs, disease mechanisms, measurements (blood tests, images, signals), and the immune response.

## 1) Levels of biological organization (small → large)

* **Molecules** (DNA, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates)
* **Organelles** (mitochondria, nucleus)
* **Cells** (basic unit of life)
* **Tissues** (groups of similar cells)
* **Organs** (heart, liver, brain)
* **Organ systems** (circulatory, nervous, immune)
* **Organism → Population → Ecosystem**

## 2) Cell basics

* **Two major types:** *Prokaryotes* (bacteria — no nucleus) and *Eukaryotes* (animals, plants — nucleus, organelles).
* **Cell membrane** controls exchange; **cytoplasm** holds organelles.
* **Mitochondria** = energy (ATP); **ribosomes** make protein; **nucleus** stores DNA.

## 3) Biomolecules (what cells are made of)

* **DNA/RNA:** genetic material.
* **Proteins:** structural + enzymes (do most work).
* **Carbohydrates:** energy and structure.
* **Lipids:** membranes and energy storage.

## 4) Genetics & the central dogma (why DNA matters)

* **Gene → (transcription) RNA → (translation) Protein.**
* **Chromosome** = bundled DNA; humans have 46.
* **Mutations** change DNA and can cause disease or variation.
* **Mendelian inheritance** (dominant/recessive) vs complex traits (many genes + environment).

## 5) Cells & disease (why biology matters for healthcare tech)

* Diseases can be from **infectious agents** (bacteria, viruses), **genetic errors**, **autoimmune reactions**, **degeneration** (e.g., Alzheimer’s), **cancer** (uncontrolled growth).
* Many diagnostics detect molecular/cellular changes (e.g., abnormal proteins, DNA mutations, pathological tissue structure).

## 6) Human body systems — one-line purpose each

* **Circulatory:** deliver O₂/nutrients, remove waste.
* **Respiratory:** gas exchange (O₂ in, CO₂ out).
* **Nervous:** sensing, control, signaling.
* **Endocrine:** hormones, long-term regulation.
* **Immune:** defend against pathogens.
* **Digestive, urinary, musculoskeletal, reproductive, integumentary (skin).**

## 7) Physiology & measurements (clinically important signals)

* **Vitals:** heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation.
* **Signals:** ECG (heart electrical), EEG (brain electrical), PPG (pulse via optical).
* **Lab tests:** CBC (blood cells), CMP (metabolic panel: glucose, electrolytes, liver/kidney), lipid panel, CRP (inflammation), HbA1c (long-term glucose).
* **Imaging:** X-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI — each with different physics and data characteristics.

## 8) Microbiology & immunology (basics)

* **Bacteria vs virus vs fungi vs parasites.**
* **Antibodies** bind antigens; vaccines train immune memory.
* **PCR** detects pathogen DNA/RNA; cultures grow bacteria.
* **Sepsis** = dysregulated immune response to infection — clinically critical.

## 9) Evolution & natural selection (big picture)

* Populations change over time; pathogens evolve (antibiotic resistance, viral variants) — important for diagnostics and model drift.

## 10) Development & cell biology (brief)

* **Stem cells** can become many cell types (regenerative medicine).
* **Cell signaling** and **apoptosis** (programmed cell death) crucial in cancer and development.

## 11) Common lab & clinical technologies you’ll meet

* **Molecular:** PCR, qPCR, sequencing (NGS).
* **Protein:** ELISA, Western blot.
* **Imaging:** ultrasound, CT, MRI, X-ray, histopathology slides.
* **Wearables/sensors:** pulse oximeters, ECG patches, glucose monitors.

## 12) How CSE skills map to biology data

* **Images (radiology, pathology):** computer vision, segmentation, classification.
* **Signals (ECG, EEG, PPG):** signal processing, time-series ML.
* **Tabular (EHR, lab tests):** predictive modeling, survival analysis.
* **Genomics:** sequence analysis, alignment, variant calling, large-scale data.
* **Privacy/security:** HIPAA-like concerns, de-identification, secure systems.

## 13) Important practical concepts for healthcare projects

* **Data quality & bias:** clinical labels are noisy; sampling bias matters.
* **Explainability:** clinicians need interpretable models.
* **Regulation & validation:** clinical validation, prospective trials, approvals (e.g., regulatory standards).
* **Ethics & privacy:** consent, data sharing limits, fairness.

## 14) Quick glossary (mini)

* **Phenotype:** observable trait.
* **Genotype:** genetic makeup.
* **Biomarker:** measurable indicator of health/disease.
* **Sensitivity/Specificity:** test performance metrics.
* **False positive/negative:** incorrect test results.
